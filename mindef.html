              In order to find out the client's painpoints of their existing
              dashboards and analysis platform, we conducted a workshop to
              better understand the various scenarios in which they would use
              the dashboard for.

              <br />
              <br />
              Based on our initial understanding, we created 2 A0 posters of
              high-level scenarios, each with a main theme that the user would
              want to achieve when doing their case analysis on the dashboard.
              These posters were used as a drawing board during the workshop,
              where the client's could pen their thoughts onto post its and
              stick it onto these posters. This process served to help guide the
              client's in figuring out and consolidating what exactly were the
              pain points they faced in a systematic manner.

              After gathering the pain points from the above activity, we
              proceeded to prioritise the pain points using our Prioritisation
              Matrix. This matrix was to help us to figure out what was the most
              important information and features to have on the dashboard, using
              2 measures - the impact this pain point has on decision making,
              and the frequency which the user will look at this piece of
              information. This leaves the matrix with 4 quadrants as seen
              below, and the client would be able to visualise the importance of
              their pain points against each other as they place the post its
              into their relevant quadrants.

            <p class="education__description">
              After conducting a full day workshop with the client, we proceeded
              to synthesise all the information by looking at the gathered pain
              points, organising, interpreting and categorising them. We
              clustered similar pain points, and this helped us to identify
              relevant solutions or considerations for each category.
              <br />
              <br />
              The synthesis process lead us to the following 3 key themes:

            The dashboard was to be built on the enterprise platform Amazon
            Quicksight. Quicksight is a business intelligence tool that creates
            data visualisations and dashboards for their users.

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              As with any enterprise product, Quicksight comes with it's pros
              and cons. While Quicksight has many technical features such as
              machine learning, there was a lot of design limitations to this
              platform. When it came to designing the dashboard, it was very
              much like PowerPoint, where everything was static and each chart
              or component had to be manually adjusted to the right place.

              <br />
              <br />
              We had to be creative in how we decided to layout each dashboard,
              playing around with images, typography and colour to ensure that
              the design of the dashboard was aligned to the visual directive of
              being consistent with NS Hub, as well as being easily understood
              by the client.

            <h3>Our Guiding Principles</h3>
            <p>
              After we deepened our understanding of the Quicksight platform and
              it's limitations, we came up with the following Guiding Principles
              to guide our dashboard design process. These Principles take into
              account the client's requirements and the design limitations of
              Quicksight, and were also communicated to the client and internal
              teams to help ensure consistency across all the dashboards.

            <p>
              When designing the dashboards, we took on an iterative approach to
              progressively improve the dashboard design, while keeping in mind
              our Guiding Principles. Below are some examples of the our
              dashboard designs and how we made use of our Principles to guide
              our process.
