                In 2019, I embarked on an Overseas CIP trip to Nepal, aiming to
                teach children in rural Nepal English, provide better facilities
                and equipment for the school, and bring joy to the children we

              Before the actual trip, we had to raise sufficient funds that will
              be used to purchase equipment and stationery we wanted to give to
              the school. I was in charge of designing the stickers we planned
              to sell at various churches, and with my ipad and index finger (I
              don‚Äôt have a stylus), I came up with 5 designs that we printed to
              sell.

            <h3>Curriculum Planning</h3>
            <p class="education__description">
              During the pre-trip planning, we also crafted out an english
              curriculum we could teach to the Nepalese children. This task
              turned out to be more difficult than we anticipated, as we quickly
              realised that the school had children aged between 6-12, and the
              english standards of the children varied greatly between each
              other. With our small team of 12 people, we were unable to figure
              out how we wanted to split the manpower across the age groups.
              <br /><br />
              Ultimately, we decided to go for a more unconventional approach,
              where the curriculum planned consisted mainly of nursery rhymes,
              popular children stories and arts and crafts. We figured that with
              the cultural difference, exposure to the nursery rhymes and
              stories we Singaporeans grew up with (such as twinkle twinkle
              little star, or the 3 little pigs) would be a fun change of pace
              for the children, and help them to learn english words through
              these songs and stories, regardless of their age.
              <br /><br />
              So, after 2 months of fundraising, planning, preparing the
              materials and rehearsing, we finally left for Nepal!

            <p class="education__description">
              Deep in the rural country side of Tanahun, we arrived at Shree
              Satya English Boarding School, where the children were waiting for
              our arrival. From here, we had 5 days to interact with the
              children and set our plan into action. After their morning
              assembly, we started off by playing some ice breakers like blow
              wind blow and duck duck goose to shake off the childrens‚Äô shyness
              around us. The games indeed helped the children loosen up, but
              their enthusiasm very literally kicked up a storm cloud as they
              ran about the sandy field of their school!
            </p>
            <p class="education__description">
              We split the school day into 2; the first half we taught the
              children nursery rhymes and a crafting activity, and the second
              half we combined all the classes for a storytelling-skit session.
              Despite our pre-trip preparations and rehearsals, we still
              struggled to to engage the children throughout the lessons due to
              the language barrier. We had to adapt our plans and relied heavily
              on drawings and gestures, to help the children understand what we
              were trying to convey. There was also a lot of intelligent
              guessess on our part when trying to understand what the children
              were trying to say to us. However, as the days went by, we got
              better at communicating with the children and oby the end of the
              week, most of the children seemed to have developed a love for
              Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and they would be singing it at every
              opportunity they had.
            </p>
            <p class="education__description">
              On the last day, we realised we had a surplus of materials so we
              decided to hold an impromptu Funfair! We came up with 5 stations -
              Bowling, 5 Stones, Balloon Sculpting, Chaptay and a Photobooth,
              and prepared stamp cards for each student to track which stations
              they have completed. The games were simple but the funfair turned
              out to be a huge success! The children were extremely eager to
              complete the stamp cards as quickly as possible, and even the
              teachers ended up taking part in the games as well! Needless to
              say the day was chaotic and tiring, but given how well received it
              was by the school, we were glad to have changed up our original
              plans for this funfair.

            <h3>Importance of Planning</h3>
            <p class="education__description">
              This trip reinforced my believe that proper planning is crucial to
              ensure things can get done. Our research during our pre-trip
              planning, despite being tedious and time consuming, proved to be
              of invaluable help when we arrived at the school. The idea of
              preparing nursery rhymes, storytelling-skits and arts and crafts
              really allowed us to engage with the children on a deeper level,
              and we would not have been able to bond with them well if we had
              stuck to our original idea of having a more traditional classroom
              based lesson, especially with the language barrier.

            <h3>Adaptability</h3>
            <p class="education__description">
              No matter how in depth your plan is, there will always be
              unexpected surprises on execution day. During this trip, there
              were multiple occasions where we had to change our plans (like how
              we had to change the physical games we planned to sitting games
              due to the dust clouds being kicked up, or how school was
              postponed by a day because of the sudden passing of an important
              minister which thus declared the day a public holiday). The only
              thing we can do is keep a cool head, adapt to the changes and
              think of possible solutions given the constraints ASAP in order
              for the day to continue to run smoothly.
